[Music] thank you Network fundamentals basic Network Theory and terminology Network fundamentals is our first lesson since before we can get into discussing networking and its complexity we need first need to Define some of the terms some of the theory and get a nice framework for where we're going to be going one note about the network plus exam is that they assume you have around 18 months experience in the industry if you don't that's okay but I am assuming that you do have some basic knowledge of computers and perhaps some working knowledge of networks so in some cases this might be redundant for you and in other cases you might be learning some new stuff either way I'm going to focus on exactly what the network plus exam wants to see and what you need to know to pass so in this module we're going to be introduced to networks and what makes up a network the terminology that's used to describe those objects it becomes flexible after a little bit of time and experience spent on the field but to understand what each object does and what its functions are in a network I want to break down some of the jargon or the technical speak and talk about what exactly is networking so some of the module objectives that we're going to cover are first to Define and describe a network and a computer network you've heard the term Network before and so I want to Define what that is and how that relates to a computer network next I want to describe the components of a network what makes a computer network I want to define the terms node and server which will be helpful going forward when we use those terms Define and describe the network backbone and the various variations of a network backbone and finally I want to define the difference between a terminal a client and a peer all right so let's get started now because networking is ubiquitous we need to define a few specific things in order to keep things in order so first Network this is an interconnected or interrelated chain group or system generally based on a purpose so for instance if we say that you're going to Facebook or LinkedIn are social networks because the purpose is to be social and to connect with other people who have similar interests likes Etc in the same way you are interrelated and you form a group now based on that a computer network is the interconnecting of two or more computers that have a basic core purpose of communicating electronically so the network of social network is to communicate with individuals about a specific topic on a computer network we need to communicate data electronically and that's the thing that joins us together the internet is one really large computer network and we will see how that comes to play later on in this course now whether your network is comprised of two computers or two thousand computers or like the internet two million computers there are uh some commonalities in networks and requirements for what makes them the first thing that are needed obviously are devices these are the actual computers the printers the switches the routers all of the devices that are going to be connected together by media now media can either be a physical connection such as copper or newer forms such as fiber optics or it can be something Wireless like Wi-Fi or a radio frequency or even cellular Wi-Fi each device however has its own language when networking and not every device knows how to communicate with the language of these other devices right because obviously a computer communicates slightly differently than a printer slightly differently than a router Etc so in order to allow all these devices to communicate with the rest of the network we have something called a network adapter sometimes referred to as a network interface controller or a NIC specifically in the term of computers and it serves this network adapter as a translator between the components the devices over the media by which the data is sent so finally to manage and govern how everything talks with everything else the network needs an operating system which is similar to like the ring leader in a circus if we can use a a metaphor there it tells the network how to work together in order to perform as efficiently as possible over the adapter over the media and with each of the devices without the operating system there wouldn't be any order or Direction in the network and no one would really know what they were doing so the network operating system is responsible really for allocating resources monitoring the activities of devices on the network over the media and managing files and data Etc now we have two devices that I want to Define one is a node and a node is any device that is connected to a Communications Network and this can be just about anything so we have uh clients and servers our nodes and so are printers and network attached storage devices and these are all what we call endpoint nodes I'm going to write that up here because that's where the data ends whereas something like a router or switch or previously we used to see a lot of hubs do what's called redistribute so those are what we call redistribution nodes okay so it's important to understand that these are both nodes anything on the network really any sort of device that's communicating is a node or being communicated with the endpoint nodes where or where the information sort of ends up or is going to a redistribution node its responsibilities to pass the data on to another either redistribution node or onto the endpoint node now a server is a network device that's responsible for sharing resources and managing certain services like addressing and we'll talk about this which is called an IP address a little later it's also uh manages devices on the network and controls the network-wide functions like permissions so not only is it going to give uh all our clients all the other nodes addresses that allow it to communicate it's also going to manage how those devices communicate and what they're allowed to do which is what we call permissions all right now this is um so you can see that the server is a type of node but I just want to describe server we're going to talk about some of the other um devices in just a moment before we do that let's talk about the network backbone okay the network backbone is responsible for carrying the majority of network traffic and it works very quickly at a very very very high speed now it might use different technology throughout this um on the backbone that's different from the rest of the network because it basically connects all the smaller networks together that's why it's called the backbone and it needs to be large fast and um capable of communicating at very high speeds because all of these computers all these smaller networks are communicating we'll talk about how that all works in a bit now there are four different types of network backbones and we're gonna I'm just gonna give you a brief definition of these now and we will come back and talk about these more in depth a little later okay the first one is called serial that's where one backbone cable connects to another one after the other like so all right so there's one backbone cable and multiple switches are connected to that cable which allow devices to connect to it there's also something called a hierarchical or distributed uh um backbone which like a family tree it has more of a family tree layout if you can imagine right okay and this backbone is in this case it's much easier to manage typical for what we'll call local area networks or lands it's much more easily scalable as you can see because I can update one part a lot faster and in this case the backbone is responsible for the traffic of the nodes on each branch so we have different branches and on each branch the backbone is responsible for that and that's how it gets a little easier now A collapsed uh backbone uses a router as the Connecting Point all right and we'll talk more about how that works a little bit later and what exactly a router does and how that's different from a switch and that's a pretty major point finally we see something called parallel which is just like a collapsed uh backbone except it has multiple cable connections and that's because that allows for more redundancy remember if you took the A Plus Class we talked about redundancy and how we want to make sure uh that we don't have what are called single points of failures so there's more than one cable connection which not only is great for redundancy it also allows for what's what we call load balancing and also a faster throughput because the computer can decide which of the cable connections to use all right so these are again we have serial hierarchical or distributed collapsed in parallel as we talk more about networks these differences will become clearer but I just wanted to cover them now and you won't probably see these specifically on the exam in this format you'll see them in other formats and but I want to lay the framework for what we're going to be talking about all right now a terminal terminal is a network Hardware device that's used for entering date data into it and displaying data from another computer Computing system it's commonly called a dummy computer because it doesn't have any processing capabilities of its own it also doesn't have much memory or anything else okay so it is literally this is a dummy it's basically a screen with a keyboard a mouse some sort of input tool right and what it's doing is simply displaying information on a bigger better server computer someplace else all right we also need something called a terminal emulator placed onto this computer so that it can emulate what's going on on the server and communicate with it since it doesn't have processing capabilities or memory of its own now this is different from what's called a client a client has its own processor and memory of its own but it accesses network resources on other nodes other servers and other clients all right so it is um rather than a server which serves up information the client takes the information and uses it now appear is a network computer that provides its own resources and services and computes on its own the best thing about appear is that it can act it is self-managed self-contained and it is both a server and a client okay so you can see how this works this cloth this peer computer serves information to this peer computer as a client this computer can serve information to this one as a client so this is what we call peer-to-peer networking it manages its own set of local policies it has its own set of users it is completely self-contained and does not need a server to operate unlike a client which does all right so just to recap what we've talked about we were we we defined what a network is and how that's different slightly from a computer network which is really what the network plus exam covers we describe the components of the network uh the adapter the network operating system the devices the media let's go ahead and write those we had media right which allowed the devices to communicate using a network adapter communicated and managed by an operating system we also defined a node and server right the node is really any um sort of device that's on we have the end point and we also have a redistribution we Define and describe the network backbone remember which is really fast and the different variations of it which if you recall included cereal which is one after the other hierarchical also called distributed then we looked at collapsed and a more redundant form parallel finally we defined terminal client and appear remember the terminal is a dummy client accesses resources on other computers and appear both serves and accesses all right so now that we've covered some of this basic terminology let's continue on talking about the fundamentals of a network And discussing more of what we need to know in order to get into the majority of this uh information on the network plus exam [Music] thank you Network fundamentals Network categories and models having discussed some of the basic components of a network and having established sort of a baseline of some terminology that we all need to be familiar with I now want to talk about the different categories of networks and as we begin to understand the differences between these categories we're also going to look at some of the basic models that networks are placed into depending on different configurations and layouts so our objectives in this module are first to describe the characteristics of a lan or what's called a local area network now this is different from a Wan or a wide area network you're going to need to be familiar with both of these terms and actually we're going to see a few different types of lands including uh man's pans cans and uh none of these are what you think these are all acronyms so a man is a metropolitan or a municipal area network uh pan is a personal area network can campus area network etc etc and as you can see from the name these these terms are really um amorphous so it really depends on some subjective uh opinions as to what these types of networks really described but anyway we're going to cover all of those so you'll be prepared for them if if and when you see them out in the field or on the test we're also going to define the difference between the internet something that I'm sure you all have heard of and then two other terms the intranet and the extranat which are more uh specific towards organizations and sort of uh uh using internet Technologies uh for a specific organization we're then going to look at uh the way networks basically are organized we're going to look at something called a centralized Network which if you recall from the previous uh video is going to involve a terminal and a Mainframe and then we're going to look at a client server Network which sort of takes the pressure off of that Central Mainframe and puts it onto a server with a client and then finally we're going to look at what a peer-to-peer network is and again that is like where we have all clients no servers so we're really looking at a descending order of centralization but at the same time we're putting more power and resources into the individual computer finally because nothing is as simple as it seems we're going to look at what's called a mixed mode Network which is a combination of sort of all of these and that'll help us as we go forward understand how an administrator of a network something we'll also talk about uh deals with these different types of needs on their entire network so let's first start talking about a local area network a lan or a local area network is a network that spans a small area typically either a building like your home or office or a floor of a much larger building you might find this in like a skyscraper so take the Empire State Building for instance which is one of the largest or tallest buildings in New York or it used to be um every floor of the building might have a different company using it so each one of those has their own land or local area network to keep them separated from one another even though they might even be using some of the same infrastructure running into that building now in a land the most commonly implemented technology and something you've probably heard of is something called ethernet and this means that the communication path taken utilizes uh cabling or short range Wireless Technologies we're going to talk about ethernet and and really what it means because it's it's also not just the hardware it really has to do with how the data is being communicated in Greater detail in an upcoming module now in a local area network a connection uh is leased by a service provider but it isn't necessarily for the land to function properly so this means I don't need an outside sort of connection in order for my land to work the reason I might need a connection to the outside from an internet service provider is going to be thanks to a Wan or a wide area network but let's talk really quickly about land administrators the people who are running these lands that might help us understand them a little clearer now land administrators are like jugglers they have to keep their eyes on all of the components of their Network at the same time hence the little GIF over here they have to have there for a broad range of versatile skills that allow them to manage and maintain all the different parts of their Network now that's only within their domain and the juggler also has to be mindful of each of the objects in the air at the same time or else they might lose track of one or all of them like the juggler if the land administrator loses track of one part of their job it's likely the entire network of moving components could come quote unquote crashing to a halt the land administrator therefore has to have a strong working knowledge of all the aspects of their Network now the land administrator should be able to handle tasks such as installation of software and hardware troubleshooting all components of the network including the servers which we'll talk about connectivity devices and media and so on and so forth and not to mention security for the network so if that isn't enough one of their most difficult tasking duties of the land administrator is being responsible for users and attending to their requests and their requirements so you can tell that the land administrator really has to be able to do a lot and we're gonna as we go through this course you'll see more and more specifically of what they have to do but let's talk about a Wan a Wan or a wide area network uh is a network that spans a larger geographical area than a lan in most cases uh the WAN is going to connect as this picture demonstrates multiple lands together and it might even utilize long-range communication such as satellite or radio frequency otherwise known as RF now one main factor that differentiates a win or wide area network from a lan is that it can enable users to connect to one another from different physical locations so whereas these are each physically sort of uh isolated in some ways you can tell the WAN connects all of these lands together okay now a Wan can be private where an organization has complete control of access to it resources and it's solely responsible for everything that occurs on that Network or a win can be public and of course the world's largest Wan is the internet now we're going to talk more about the internet in detail shortly but I just want to point out that the biggest wide area network we have is the WAN and unlike the land which is geographically isolated and can be controlled by a relatively few number of people the WAN has very different needs now there are also different types of lands that are out there now some of these classifications um we might get argument from certain individuals just because this is sort of open to some subjectivity but these are covered on the examine which is the reason I want to make sure we cover them the first one that we've seen a few times when we talked if you were here for a plus is called a pan or a personal area network a pan is two to three computers connected together by cables and a wireless pan or wpn is going to be using Bluetooth or infrared Technologies generally speaking when we are talking about pans uh for purposes of the exam we're really talking about Bluetooth now I might consider pan a sort of local area network but for our sake we're just gonna group this into wands right now but this could be considered something a little different okay so I'm just gonna sort of put brackets around that and a w pan or a wireless pan if we put that W in front of it uh occurs when the computers are connected together wirelessly but not through an access point right so they're connected literally uh to one another thanks to the wireless technology but there is no sort of Central Access Point that they all connect to now the next type is a can or a campus area network and I'm assuming from the name you can guess that this is a Wan that spans the geographical area comparable to like a school or a campus or a business park such as Yahoo now again some people might consider this a land some might consider this a win but for our sake we're just going to assume that this is dealing with some sort of Campus some sort of school some sort of area that is contained all by one organization so for instance if I had uh four buildings all connected uh and each of them has let's say four floors right there might be a lan on each floor or in each building and then connecting each land together is going to be this can which is a sort of wide area network but because the wide area network could denote uh the internet and the cloud is sort of the best descriptor of that we want to call it something slightly different now a man is a metropolitan or it could also be a municipal area network and as the name implies It's relatively the size of a city or a town or a metropolitan area so if I have a business that like the cam uh has several buildings but the buildings are now separated over the course of the city as opposed to some in my own campus then I'm probably going to use this terminology again or a global area network I think it's sort of redundant but these are networks that go from country to country or around uh these are networks that go all the way from country to country all the way around the world they span the globe and they're going to utilize Technologies uh like satellite probably and the reason we're going to call this uh again is because generally speaking the global area network again is all controlled by one sort of company as opposed to a Wan which as we just discussed could include either all being controlled by one company or all being controlled by uh you know disparate companies such as the internet finally an En which is the only one that breaks from this convention is called an Enterprise Network it's a network that includes usually aspects of both a Wan and a lan and it's typically owned and operated by a single entity or organization just like a gan might be now again these terms are very fluid and flexible and depending on who you talk to they'll call it different things so you might I worked for a an organization we never used the word man we always use the word when talking about the network that was deployed over the entire city however certain individuals certain organizations will call these different things and the names might change as well but it's important to have a firm understanding of this just from a basic you know definition standpoint but also so that if you go out in the fields and you hear people talking these different terms you can talk the talk as well now unlike land administrators whose Duties are quite varied when administrators are typically specialists in their respective Fields so they're responsible for more complex infrastructures and as a result uh they need to be more fluent in say routing structures and troubleshooting different difficult or different network issues they're also responsible for say data versus voice systems and when administrators concentrate generally on network oriented problems and not user related issues like a land administrator so with a a lan we're really going to get these user-oriented tasks right because they're dealing with the user on a day-to-day basic a Wan administrator is really not dealing with these or they're dealing with sometimes what we would refer to as the back end and in some cases as well they're also going to be a little more specialized in what they do since what they're dealing with is a lot more complex a lan administrator can sort of be a jack of all trades a wand administrator we want to be a master of exactly what it is he or she is dealing with uh one of the other main duties of a Wan administrator is the development and implementation of certain scripts that are going to automate certain Network processes and they're also going to plan for and test and push out upgrades and updates to the infrastructure of the network network wide whereas a land administrator is going to do this on a sort of local basis perhaps to the computers in their Network so we can see sort of how these are getting differentiated here a Wan administrators a lot more specialized and they're not focused on user oriented tasks they're looking at Network stuff so you can see a Wan administrator again dealing with the back end much more specifically generally more Technical and generally also a little bit more training than a land administrator now let's talk about the internet or the World Wide Web which is a public wide area network right it is the largest Wan that we have and it essentially connects every country on the planet in some ways every computer on the planet it's used for many different things including but certainly not limited to sending and receiving email initiating and completing commercial and private transactions uh commute communicating and allowing people to connect to one another that are sitting in the same room or perhaps even on the other side of the world the internet is really the method by which everyone in the world can communicate in one way or the other and in some ways we can actually use it to create our own virtual lands that are private and we'll talk more about that the other thing that's important to know is every bit of data is stored somewhere on a server typically in the form of a web page and in order to access the data data on the internet you're going to have several different considerations that are going to be made first of all you need to have a web browser of some sort or you're gonna need to utilize a certain generic protocol and have something like uh so if we're talking a web browser we're gonna need to use a safari Internet Explorer Google Chrome Firefox Etc but they're all using HTTP which is a specific protocol and it has a certain port which by the way is 80. we'll talk more about those later in order to allow communication to occur and this might be different from say another form of communication such as FTP or remoting in and so on and secondly all devices that want to connect to the internet must be assigned we would call an IP address all things on the internet due to the way it works are governed by this IP or the Internet Protocol we're going to revisit this in a future module but IP allows all of this to happen if it wasn't 4ip we wouldn't have an internet at least in the way we know it so again the internet is this largest global wide area network that we have in the world and it's for use it's public and everyone can use it if they you know have a provider that gives them access now this is different from an intranet an intranet is a company's private version of the Internet it's commonly connected to the internet so that people can uh connect even if they're not locally at the same place physically but the purpose of an intranet is to keep your network or portions of your network segregated from the unsecure and possibly even dangerous internet so a company might use an intranet for security purposes or for confidentiality if they have certain files and folders they want to post up and the intranet uses the same services and protocols as the internet so the reason it shares this name is intra enter to the organization but it shares the same name because it's using all of the same services in other words IP HTTP you still use a browser so on and so forth so it's still accessed the same way you would the internet through a browser and a web page on the world wide web now all of this is different from an Extranet as the name implies with an intranet your network is completely secure from the internet right you control who has access to your network in every facet but what if your company organization needs to allow certain individuals to have access to your network but you don't want them to have access to all of your network in this case we're going to use something called an Extranet it gives you the ability to Grant uh access to specific portions of your network and your Extranet so you can give access to specific people typically vendors suppliers individuals that might need minimal or temporary access at the same time your Extranet is restricting them from having full access to the rest of your network or your intranet so it's really an extension of your intranet but it's the part that is exterior look at that extra to your organization so again the internet is is a you know using a certain degree of protocols and uh technologies that allows anyone in the world to access information the intranet is sort of a private internet for your organization and the Extranet is the part of that intranet that you're going to let other people from outside of your organization have access to now I just want to Define what a segment is since we might see this term come up a bit in the future a segment is a portion of a Network that has linked devices and that are separated by a connectivity device such as a switch or a router all right so we haven't talked about switches and routers yet but we're going to and so what I mean is I might have a lan okay and let's say that for simplicity's sake My Lan is consisting of four computers all connected through a central device which we're going to call a switch now remember if they weren't connecting through that Central device this would be called a pan a personal area network but this is a lan has a central device and let's say this Central device and this I'm really simplifying it but let's say it connects to another switch and that other switch has four computers connected to it now I have different segments of my network that uh I can join together in certain information but I can also exclude them from certain information in order to allow for performance by segmenting we allow communication between the nodes on each segment to be uninhibited by the traffic on other segments so I'm not worried about uh if if computer a wants to talk to computer C I don't need to involve all of these guys I can just allow them to talk directly and so what it's doing is it's it's basically keeping a lot of traffic from going over this line and therefore we're increasing speed we're increasing throughput and we're decreasing the amount of sort of errors that can occur and we're segmenting everything out to make it easier to fix in the future as well now let's talk about a network model we've just talked about some Network categories so now let's talk about the different models that these are going to fit into a network model is a design uh specification if you will that identifies the transmission path that nodes on the network are going to use in order to communicate it basically determines whether the communication and the processing is centralized or distributed so in a centralized Network this is where we have our Mainframe in our terminals the host computer this guy the Mainframe provides all of the processing and all of the network communication and the users that interface with the host computer do so through these Terminals and by using a terminal emulator that's on the screen centralized networks are highly effective but the problem is they can be a little costly to maintain because this sucker right here needs to be so powerful that what if I have instead of just three computers what if I had a thousand computers and what if this goes out well now I'm in major issue I have a major problem so this is why a lot of times we use what's called a client server model the client server model it in the client server model the server is responsible the server right here is responsible for providing services like file sharing and printer sharing and authentication services and data storage and management to these clients the main difference between the centralized and the client server model is that in this client server Network the processing and the resources can be allocated wherever they are needed including on the client and they can also be distributed whenever necessary and the end nodes These Guys these clients can still perform their own processing and end user tasks without having to constantly talk over to the server so if I need a file for instance I can get that file do the work on my computer and then I can save it back to the server whereas here on the centralized Mainframe terminal setup all the work is actually done on this major huge computer and here in the terminal we're just sort of having a portal to see what's going on now both of these are different from what we call a peer-to-peer Network we talked about appear in the previous module but a peer-to-peer Network which you might also see as P2P or PTP uh is a network in which each node on the network is responsible for its own Computing its own management its own security its own storage its own resource sharing like printers it's completely decentralized and it's commonly referred to as a work group now this is sort of like if we were going to make a reference to a political metaphor this would be like communism everyone works together equally and everyone is responsible for their own thing and then they can share that with everyone else whereas in a client server sort of uh model we're dealing with say a democracy in which you have a president or prime minister someone who's going to make a lot of the decisions but you are still at Liberty to exercise a lot of your own stuff and that's very different from say a terminal Mainframe which is would be equivalent to like a monarchy a really strict here I should say tyrannical monarchy in which everything is decided for you and you make no decisions on your own so one of the problem with work groups is that user accounts need to be replicated onto each node so that if I want to get access to this computer and I usually work on computer y all of my username password everything is going to be on there and if it's not done if I don't sort of copy everything over there's no way I can gain access so this is the problem with this model is each person's their own but if x has wheat and I have corn there's sort of no sharing that's automatically set up we have to create our own sort of share and then if someone else says something I have to share with them and so on and so forth now we might sometimes mix these together into what's called a mixed mode Network and that's just like it sounds it mixes aspects of two or more of the different network models an example might be a work group of computers connected together via some sort of short range Wireless while allowing those computers to connect to a Mainframe computer and using terminal emulation so alternative we might have a work group and then a centralized server Etc so we see we can see mixed mode networks they're usually uh not as popular in huge Enterprises because of the lack of control um except in certain specific instances uh but we do see them and it's important to know that just like in anything we can mix and match to however we want the the network to work all right so now just to recap what we've talked about we can now describe and Define the characteristics of a lan or a local area network as well as a Wan or a wide area network and we also talked about several of the uh different types of lands or in some cases lands including a can or campus area network a man or municipal or metropolitan area network a pan or personal area network which is where the computers connect directly to one another and then we looked at a gan or a global area network and then we also talked about en or an Enterprise Network okay so these are all uh different acronyms that you need to learn for the exam we also talked about uh an internet intranet an Extranet remember the internet is that World Wide Web right the cloud the intranet is sort of using this Cloud but in your company and keeping it private that's my little building and the Extranet is allowing access of your company private intranet to perhaps certain individuals from outside so it's just a little bit of that we also talked about a centralized Network which is mostly what we talk about when we deal with terminals and mainframes and we'll sort of deal with this a little bit too when we get into uh virtualization when we talked about Thin and Thick clients this is the idea of a thin client on a network with a a server of some sort or a Mainframe I should say that is going to do all the processing for it we also looked at a client server Network which is the majority of the types of networks we see in Enterprise settings and a peer-to-peer Network which we also call a work group network in which every peer is both a client and a server responsible for its own um its own resources and so on I think we use the metaphor that this might be like uh communism this might be like a client server might be like sort of uh democracy of some sort or a republic of some sort and a centralized Network would be more like I guess I should say a democracy that is also republic since um we do have officials and there's someone above us right but a prime minister a president sort of system and then a centralized Network would be like a tyranny or a tyrannical Monarch I should say and then we have a mixed mode Network which is sort of a combination of uh the above great so we've talked now about uh some of the basic terminology we've talked about the models we've also talked about the different categories so let's finish up this basic Network fundamentals area by talking about what are what are called topologies how the networks are physically set up and how they logically communicate with one another [Music] thank you
